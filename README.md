**nathanroberts.com** hosts the portfolio and personal info of me, Nathan Roberts 👋🏼

I'm a product designer at Experian in Orange County, CA. Before Experian, I was an interaction design lead at Oakley.

I use this site to write more often, share my work and experiment with web stuff. This version uses Jekyll, Github Pages and Tachyons CSS.

I'm constantly playing around with it, so things may look broken at times.

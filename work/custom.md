Still working on this case study. Should have something up this week :)

{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Overview

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
Custom accounts for a large part of Oakley's direct-to-consumer business. The oakley.com Custom back-end was built by Fluid and maintained by Oakley's e-commerce team, led by Custom PM George Steihl. The interaction design team led UI/UX for the experience.

### Role

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
For the first half of the project, I directed the design in collaboration with Aaron Dodson. After Aaron left Oakley, I continued iterating on the design while coordinating deliverables and constant communication with the development team, all in sync with George.

### Challenges

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
In 2015, traffic data was showing a growing trend toward mobile for Custom. The existing experience had a three key problems we wanted to solve:

- The existing interface didn't match the latest product detail page interface, which broke consistency across a user's potential experience.
- When scrolling to choosing customizable attributes, a user couldn't instantly see her changes in the hero product image because the image scrolled with the rest of the page
- The Add to Cart button was out of view until the user scrolled

### Solutions

- Matching the interface was pretty easy - just a matter of providing designs with updated styles to match the latest product detail page. Since we worked with a vendor to execute these updates, I managed the design, process and hand-off to the vendor development team using Zeplin.
- The scrolling issues were mainly a front-end development challenge. We worked closely with the development team to ensure execution was as we envisioned. We explained through a few meetings the "why" and also had some thoughts on the "how." We also provided external site references to the interaction we wanted to mimic and eventually arrived at a solid solution.

### What I learned

- We could have saved some time and headache explaining the scrolling interaction we envisioned to the development team with a prototype built in After Effects or Principle. Up until then, prototyping hadn't been a part of our toolbox.
- Zeplin was a life-saver and likely made up for any time wasted on back-and-forth with the dev team on the scrolling interaction by streamlining deliverables. We realized the impact of this tool most here. Previously, we spent way too much time creating red-lined spec sheets for interaction-heavy projects like this one.
- When team members move on and it's your responsibility to continue with a project, how do you minimize the time it takes to get familiar with the nitty-gritty of their Sketch and file organization? Fortunately, since Aaron and I collaborated closely, there was little time wasted taking over where he left off. But it's a good idea to have a general understanding and agreement of how design files are produced in preparation for events like a teammate departure.

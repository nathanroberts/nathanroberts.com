We are exploring some user flows and features for leveraging data to verify income and assets in lending. These few screens are part of a larger exploration demonstrating a user being presented with the ability to verify their income and assets in a digital loan application.

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
We started this exploration with a desktop user experience already in place. The purpose behind further exploration is to:
- Improve the mobile user experience
- Simplify the UI
- Explore the idea of incentivizing the user to add more of their accounts

In a few weeks, we plan to test our ideas by putting a prototype in front of real users.

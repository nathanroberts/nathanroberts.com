I've spent the last 6 months at [Experian](http://experian.com) working primarily on three products: [eResolve](https://www.experian.com/consumer-information/virtual-debt-resolution-negotiation-eResolve.html), [Text for Credit](http://www.experian.com/blogs/news/2017/07/11/text-credit-modernizes-lending-industry-allowing-consumers-obtain-real-time-credit-via-text/) and [Income and Asset Verification](http://www.experian.com/consumer-information/account-aggregation-solutions.html).  All three projects are still in progress.

## eResolve

### Overview

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
Experian offers eResolve to businesses who want to take a human-friendly, digital first approach to collections. The process is less threatening for consumers and gives them the flexibility to access their account at any time. It also increases the consistency and efficiency of the debt collection process.

### Role

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
When I arrived at Experian, research had been conducted on an early version of eResolve. I've since translated the insights gathered from the research into action items that will refine the product. This includes re-thinking the user flow, content strategy and visual design. After multiple iterations of sketches and rough prototypes, I presented a refined prototype to stakeholders and the development team.

Now the design team is fleshing out the visual design in preparation for the development team. We'll work together with them through the development process to ensure the design is executed, with special attention to interaction, performance and device support.

### Challenges

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** The early version of eResolve was jam-packed with extra information and heavy on decorations. This left users unsure of where to look or what to do.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** We wanted the user to have more control by negotiating payment amounts, terms and dates but also set parameters that a financial institution would accept. We are currently exploring if/how we can leverage data to propose terms that work well for both the user and the financial institution.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** After a user agrees to a payment plan, what's the best way to interact with them? Payment reminder options, progress updates,  and pay-off celebrations are all being considered as options to continue the human-friendly approach outside of the initial experience.

### Solution

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** We simplified the user flow by taking a "[one thing per page](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/better-form-design-one-thing-per-page/)" approach: instead of putting everything on one page, we separated the process into multiple, minimal pages.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** We cleaned up the interface by removing extraneous containers, shapes, shadows and a complex layout. We added a clear typographic hierarchy, friendly color scheme and straightforward single-column layout.

### What I have learned

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** **Data is everything.** The research done before I arrived paved the way to a data-driven design approach. I could point back to it to justify every design decision I made.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** **Meaningful data comes from drawing insights from user interviews** When reading or listening to user interviews, it's important to listen *underneath* the words people say to get to the heart of the words. It's also important to understand who they are and what they're about for context and even more meaning.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** **Listen to the user.** The fewer assumptions we make about a design - and the more we ask the humans it is designed for, the better suited it will be for them.

I've spent the last 6 months at [Experian](http://experian.com) working primarily on three products: [eResolve](https://www.experian.com/consumer-information/virtual-debt-resolution-negotiation-eResolve.html), [Text for Credit](http://www.experian.com/blogs/news/2017/07/11/text-credit-modernizes-lending-industry-allowing-consumers-obtain-real-time-credit-via-text/) and [Income and Asset Verification](http://www.experian.com/consumer-information/account-aggregation-solutions.html).  All three projects are still in progress. Stay tuned for a full write-up and images of key Experian projects.

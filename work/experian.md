I've spent the last 6 months at [Experian](http://experian.com) working primarily on three products: [eResolve](https://www.experian.com/consumer-information/virtual-debt-resolution-negotiation-eResolve.html), [Text for Credit](http://www.experian.com/blogs/news/2017/07/11/text-credit-modernizes-lending-industry-allowing-consumers-obtain-real-time-credit-via-text/) and [Income and Asset Verification](http://www.experian.com/consumer-information/account-aggregation-solutions.html).  All three projects are still in progress.

## eResolve

{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Overview

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
Experian offers eResolve to businesses who want to take a human-friendly, digital first approach to collections. The process is less threatening for consumers and gives them the flexibility to access their account at any time. It also increases the consistency and efficiency of the debt collection process.

### Role

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
When I arrived at Experian, my director handed me deck of research (user interviews and insights) on an early version of eResolve. I spent some time digging into this research to familiarize myself with where the product was and where it needs to go to best serve its users. I translated the insights gathered from the research into action items to refine the product. This included re-thinking the user flow, simplifying the content strategy and refreshing the visual design. After jotting down some thoughts and ideas, I sketched them out to see the form. After multiple iterations of sketches and rough prototypes, I presented a refined prototype to stakeholders and the development team.

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
Now I'm working a designer on my team to flesh out the visual design. She's addressing things like different states of the UI and thinking through some alternative approaches to a few steps in the flow. We're also beginning to meet and align with the development team since we will work together with them through the development process to ensure the design is executed, with special attention to interaction, performance and device support.

### Challenges

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**‚Ä¢** The early version of eResolve was jam-packed with extra information and heavy on decorations. This left users unsure of where to look or what to do.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**‚Ä¢** We wanted the user to have more control by negotiating payment amounts, terms and dates but also set parameters that a financial institution would be comfortable accepting. We are currently exploring if/how we can leverage data to intelligently propose terms that work well for both the user and the financial institution.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**‚Ä¢** After a user agrees to a payment plan, what's the best way to interact with them? Payment reminder options, progress updates,  and pay-off celebrations are all being considered as options to continue the human-friendly approach outside of the initial experience.


{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Solution

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**‚Ä¢** We simplified the user flow by taking a "[one thing per page](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/better-form-design-one-thing-per-page/)" approach: instead of putting everything on one page, we separated the process into multiple, minimal pages.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**‚Ä¢** We cleaned up the interface by removing extraneous containers, shapes, shadows and a complex layout. We added a clear typographic hierarchy, friendly color scheme and straightforward single-column layout.

Here are a few mobile screens from the project showing the work done.

### What I have learned (so far)

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**‚Ä¢** **Data is everything.** The research done before I arrived paved the way to a data-driven design approach. I can reference it to justify every design decision made.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**‚Ä¢** **Meaningful data comes from drawing insights from user interviews** When conducting and analyzing user interviews, it's important to listen *underneath* the words people say to get to the heart of the words. It's also important to understand who they are and what they're about for context and even more meaning.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**‚Ä¢** **Put the user first.** The fewer assumptions we make about a design, and the more we ask the users it is designed for, the better the product will be for the user.

## Income and Asset Verification

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
We're exploring some user flows and features for leveraging data to verify income and assets in lending. These few screens are part of a larger exploration demonstrating a user being presented with the ability to verify their income and assets in a digital loan process (an online mortgage application, for example).

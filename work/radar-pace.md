Oakley and [Intel](http://intel.com) partnered to create Radar Pace, a real-time voice activated coaching system leveraging sensor-driven eyewear and your iOS or Android smartphone. I worked with Intel's New Devices Group UI/UX team to whiteboard ideas, create prototypes, conduct user research, present findings to stakeholders and iterate on UI/UX for Radar Pace on iOS and Android platforms. My primary role was to ensure the overall digital experience and visual design of the app met Oakley's standards for product design.

### What I learned

- We got too far into the design before we put the product in front of people for feedback. **Prototype as early as possible.**
- Most of the user research we did later on was in a board room. **Testing prototypes with users in the intended environment** provides more accurate feedback and drives clearer insights. This give us meaningful data to take action on, leading to a more focused product. This did happen later, but after the product was nearly built, costing time and money when iterating.
- The product shipped later than intended because so many features were mandated into the launch. Launching with a MVP would have shortened the development timeline, brought us to market earlier and afforded us [validated learning](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) for future iterations.

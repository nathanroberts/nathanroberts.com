At Oakley, I collaborated with the interaction design team, internal and external stakeholders and third-party vendors to design several native apps including [Mad Science](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mad-science/id981695340) and [Radar Pace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radar-pace/id1108147139). We also shipped UX/UI, front-end development and back-end integration for [oakley.com](http://oakley.com)'s e-commerce and marketing web experiences. In 2015, Oakley.com generated approximately $60M in revenue and approximately 36M sessions.


## Radar Pace

### Overview

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
In partnership between Oakley and [Intel](http://intel.com), Radar Pace is a real-time voice activated coaching system leveraging sensor-driven eyewear and your iOS or Android smartphone.

### Role

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
In collaboration with Intel's New Devices Group UI/UX team, we worked remotely and in-person to whiteboard ideas, create prototypes, conducted user research, present findings to stakeholders and iterated on UI/UX for Radar Pace on iOS and Android platforms. My primary role was to ensure the UI/UX integrity of the app met Oakley's high standards for product design.

### Challenges

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
In the beginning, I did not have much native mobile design experience. Early on, I felt in over my head with a dual-platform app dependent on pairing with external hardware. Being nose deep in all of it was an incredibly valuable learning experience from my perspective.

### What I learned

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** **Prototype as early as possible.** We got too far into the design before we put the product in front of people for feedback

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** Most of the user research we did later on was in a board room. **Test prototypes with users in the intended environment** provides more accurate feedback and drives clearer insights. This give us meaningful data to take action on, leading to a more focused product. (This did happen later, but after the product was nearly built, costing time and money when iterating)

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** Because of the complicated nature of wearables (not just one but *two* devices involved), creating and user **testing prototypes progressively as the hardware improved** or changed would have solved headaches down the road.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** We assumed too much of what users would want in the product. This was misguided by egos and efficiency up front, which cost us churn/time down the road.

## Oakley Custom

### Overview

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
Custom accounts for a large part of Oakley's direct-to-consumer business. The oakley.com Custom back-end was built by Fluid and maintained by Oakley's e-commerce team, led by Custom PM George Steihl. The interaction design team led UI/UX for the experience.

### Role

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
For the first half of the project, I directed the design in collaboration with Aaron Dodson. After Aaron left Oakley, I continued iterating on the design while coordinating deliverables and constant communication with the development team, all in sync with George.

### Challenges

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
In 2015, traffic data was showing a growing trend toward mobile for Custom. The existing experience had a three key problems we wanted to solve:

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** The existing interface didn't match the latest product detail page interface, which broke consistency across a user's potential experience.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** When scrolling to choosing customizable attributes, a user couldn't instantly see her changes in the hero product image because the image scrolled with the rest of the page

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** The Add to Cart button was out of view until the user scrolled

### Solutions

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** Matching the interface was pretty easy - just a matter of providing designs with updated styles to match the latest product detail page. Since we worked with a vendor to execute these updates, I managed the design, process and hand-off to the vendor development team using Zeplin.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** The scrolling issues were mainly a front-end development challenge. We worked closely with the development team to ensure execution was as we envisioned. We explained through a few meetings the "why" and also had some thoughts on the "how." We also provided external site references to the interaction we wanted to mimic and eventually arrived at a solid solution.


### What I learned

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** We could have saved some time and headache explaining the scrolling interaction we envisioned to the development team with a prototype built in After Effects or Principle. Up until then, prototyping hadn't been a part of our toolbox.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** Zeplin was a life-saver and likely made up for any time wasted on back-and-forth with the dev team on the scrolling interaction by streamlining deliverables. We realized the impact of this tool most here. Previously, we spent way too much time creating red-lined spec sheets for interaction-heavy projects like this one.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4}
**â€¢** When team members move on and it's your responsibility to continue with a project, how do you minimize the time it takes to get familiar with the nitty-gritty of their Sketch and file organization? Fortunately, since Aaron and I collaborated closely, there was little time wasted taking over where he left off. But it's a good idea to have a general understanding and agreement of how design files are produced in preparation for events like a teammate departure.

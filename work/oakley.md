At Oakley, I collaborated with the interaction design team, internal and external stakeholders and third-party vendors to design several native apps including [Mad Science](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mad-science/id981695340) and [Radar Pace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radar-pace/id1108147139). We also shipped UX/UI, front-end development and back-end integration for [oakley.com](http://oakley.com)'s e-commerce and marketing web experiences.

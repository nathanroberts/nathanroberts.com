At Oakley, I worked with the interaction design team, internal and external stakeholders and third-party vendors to design several native apps including [Mad Science](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mad-science/id981695340) and [Radar Pace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radar-pace/id1108147139). We also shipped UX/UI, front-end development and back-end integration for [oakley.com](http://oakley.com)'s e-commerce and marketing web experiences. In 2015, Oakley.com generated approximately $60M in revenue and approximately 36M sessions.

## Radar Pace

{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Overview

{: .f5 .f4-m .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
Oakley and [Intel](http://intel.com) partnered to create Radar Pace, a real-time voice activated coaching system leveraging sensor-driven eyewear and your iOS or Android smartphone.

{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Role

{: .f5 .f4-m .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
I worked with Intel's New Devices Group UI/UX team to whiteboard ideas, create prototypes, conduct user research, present findings to stakeholders and iterate on UI/UX for Radar Pace on iOS and Android platforms. My primary role was to ensure the overall digital experience and visual design of the app met Oakley's standards for product design.

### Challenges

*[Writing this now - Will touch on main sections of the app and how we arrived at the solution, visual design and working with voice interactions]*

Here are a few screens showing the Profile and Plan sections of the app. These give you a good sense of the organization of the app and the visual design. *[More screens needed?]*

### What I learned

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** We got too far into the design before we put the product in front of people for feedback. **Prototype as early as possible.**

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** Most of the user research we did later on was in a board room. **Testing prototypes with users in the intended environment** provides more accurate feedback and drives clearer insights. This give us meaningful data to take action on, leading to a more focused product. This did happen later, but after the product was nearly built, costing time and money when iterating.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** The product shipped later than intended because so many features were mandated into the launch. Launching with a MVP would have shortened the development timeline, brought us to market earlier and afforded us [validated learning](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) for future iterations.

## Oakley Custom

{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Overview

{: .f5 .f4-m .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
Custom accounts for a large part of Oakley's direct-to-consumer business. The oakley.com Custom back-end was built by Fluid and maintained by Oakley's e-commerce team, led by Custom PM George Steihl. The interaction design team led UI/UX for the experience.

{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Role

{: .f5 .f4-m .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
For the first half of the project, I directed the design in collaboration with Aaron Dodson. After Aaron left Oakley, I continued iterating on the design while coordinating deliverables and constant communication with the development team, all in sync with George.

{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Challenges

{: .f5 .f4-m .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
In 2015, traffic data was showing a growing trend toward mobile for Custom. The existing experience had a three key problems we wanted to solve:

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** The existing interface didn't match the latest product detail page interface, which broke consistency across a user's potential experience.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** When scrolling to choosing customizable attributes, a user couldn't instantly see her changes in the hero product image because the image scrolled with the rest of the page

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** The Add to Cart button was out of view until the user scrolled

{: .mb2 .mt4}
### Solutions

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** Matching the interface was pretty easy - just a matter of providing designs with updated styles to match the latest product detail page. Since we worked with a vendor to execute these updates, I managed the design, process and hand-off to the vendor development team using Zeplin.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** The scrolling issues were mainly a front-end development challenge. We worked closely with the development team to ensure execution was as we envisioned. We explained through a few meetings the "why" and also had some thoughts on the "how." We also provided external site references to the interaction we wanted to mimic and eventually arrived at a solid solution.


{: .mb2 .mt4}
### What I learned

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** We could have saved some time and headache explaining the scrolling interaction we envisioned to the development team with a prototype built in After Effects or Principle. Up until then, prototyping hadn't been a part of our toolbox.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** Zeplin was a life-saver and likely made up for any time wasted on back-and-forth with the dev team on the scrolling interaction by streamlining deliverables. We realized the impact of this tool most here. Previously, we spent way too much time creating red-lined spec sheets for interaction-heavy projects like this one.

{: .db .ml2 .mr4-ns .f5 .f4-ns}
**‚Ä¢** When team members move on and it's your responsibility to continue with a project, how do you minimize the time it takes to get familiar with the nitty-gritty of their Sketch and file organization? Fortunately, since Aaron and I collaborated closely, there was little time wasted taking over where he left off. But it's a good idea to have a general understanding and agreement of how design files are produced in preparation for events like a teammate departure.

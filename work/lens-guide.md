Still working on this case study. Should have something up this week :)

### Overview

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .dark-gray .mb4}
Oakley's lens inventory was growing. With so many options available, users were struggling to find the right lens. We created the lens guide to help people understand our lens and guide them to the right lens.

The interaction team worked with R&amp;D to dig deeper into the purpose of each lens and the problem it solved for people. We worked with the marketing team to organize and speak about the lenses in a way that made sense to our consumers.

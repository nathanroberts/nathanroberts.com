## Work Summary

{: .f4-l .lh-copy .mt0 .dark-gray .mb4}
After graduating [college](http://bradley.edu) in 2006, I've been building websites small and large. In 2008-2010, I launched and managed a small e-commerce business (<$100K annually) for an internationally known photographer. I spent some time at small agencies from 2010-2012 until I joined [Oakley](http://oakley.com) in 2013 as an Interaction Designer. Later, I became the Interaction Design lead for all digital experiences. In 2017, I joined [Experian](http://experian.com) as a product design lead.

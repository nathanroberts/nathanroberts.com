I'm Nathan Roberts, a product designer living in Southern California. I'm most invested when I'm building something meaningful for people that creates positive impact.

I lead a product design team at [Experian](http://experian.com) focused on innovation in the finance industry. Our human-centered design approach activates principles outlined in [Lean Startup](http://a.co/jggDQhk) and [Change by Design](http://a.co/3am50TP). Before that, I led the interaction design team for [Oakley](http://oakley.com) where we shipped UX/UI and development for oakley.com and designed several native apps including [Mad Science](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mad-science/id981695340) and [Radar Pace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radar-pace/id1108147139).

I married my wife, Cori, 10 years(!!!) ago. Together we have three kids: Abram ðŸ‘¦, Hazel ðŸ‘§ and Maren ðŸ‘§. We do our best to center our lives around effectively parenting our children.

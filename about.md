I'm Nathan Roberts, a product designer living in Southern California. I'm most invested when I'm building something meaningful for people that creates positive impact.

Currently, I lead a product design team at [Experian](http://experian.com) centered around innovation in the finance industry. Our human-centered design approach activates principles outlined in [Lean Startup](http://a.co/jggDQhk) and [Change by Design](http://a.co/3am50TP). Previously, I led the interaction design team for [Oakley](http://oakley.com) on oakley.com and partnered with the Intel UX team on a wearable product/iOS and Android app called Radar Pace.

I'm most invested when I'm building something meaningful for people that creates positive impact. I enjoy working with others, not in a silo. I get excited about technology and using it to improve our everyday lives.

I have an *incredible* family -- I'm a proud dad! My wife and I married 10 years(!!!) ago. Together we have three kids: Abram ğŸ‘¦, Hazel ğŸ‘§ and Maren ğŸ‘§. We do our best to center our lives around effectively parenting our children.

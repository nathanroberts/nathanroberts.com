**nathanroberts.com** hosts the portfolio and personal info of me, Nathan Roberts 👋🏼

I'm a product design lead at [Experian](http://experian.com) 💳  &nbsp;Before that, I was an interaction design lead at [Oakley](http://oakley.com) 😎

I use this site to write more often, share my work and experiment with web stuff. This version uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Tachyons CSS](http://tachyons.io).

I'm constantly playing around with the site, so things may look 🤔 at times. Thanks for stopping by!

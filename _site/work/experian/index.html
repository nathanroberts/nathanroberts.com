    <p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">I‚Äôve spent the last 6 months at <a href="http://experian.com">Experian</a> working primarily on three products: <a href="https://www.experian.com/consumer-information/virtual-debt-resolution-negotiation-eResolve.html">eResolve</a>, <a href="http://www.experian.com/blogs/news/2017/07/11/text-credit-modernizes-lending-industry-allowing-consumers-obtain-real-time-credit-via-text/">Text for Credit</a> and <a href="http://www.experian.com/consumer-information/account-aggregation-solutions.html">Income and Asset Verification</a>.</p>

<h2 class="mt5" id="eresolve">eResolve</h2>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">eResolve is a human-friendly, digital first approach to collections. Traditionally, debt collectors feel threatening and inflexible. eResolve replaces the old experience by speaking to consumers respectfully and giving them flexible payment options.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="role">Role</h3>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">I spent some time digging into some existing user interviews and insights to familiarize myself with the product and how it could better meet the needs of its users. Translating the insights into action items allowed me to create a picture of how to improve eResolve. I needed to:</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> Re-think the user flow</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong>  Simplify the content strategy</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong>  Refresh the visual design</p>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">After jotting down some thoughts and ideas, I sketched them out to see the form. After multiple iterations of sketches and rough prototypes, I presented a refined prototype to stakeholders and the development team.</p>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Now I‚Äôm working a designer on my team to flesh out the visual design. She‚Äôs addressing things like different states of the UI and thinking through some alternative approaches to a few steps in the flow. We‚Äôre also beginning to meet and align with the development team since we will work together with them through the development process to ensure the design is executed, with special attention to interaction, performance and device support.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> The early version of eResolve was jam-packed with extra information and heavy on decorations. This left users unsure of where to look or what to do.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> We wanted the user to have more control by negotiating payment amounts, terms and dates but also set parameters that a financial institution would be comfortable accepting. We are currently exploring if/how we can leverage data to intelligently propose terms that work well for both the user and the financial institution.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> After a user agrees to a payment plan, what‚Äôs the best way to interact with them? Payment reminder options, progress updates,  and pay-off celebrations are all being considered as options to continue the human-friendly approach outside of the initial experience.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> We simplified the user flow by taking a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/better-form-design-one-thing-per-page/">one thing per page</a>‚Äù approach: instead of putting everything on one page, we separated the process into multiple, minimal pages.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> We cleaned up the interface by removing extraneous containers, shapes, shadows and a complex layout. We added a clear typographic hierarchy, friendly color scheme and straightforward single-column layout.</p>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Here are a few of the screens we presented:</p>

<p class="wider"><img src="/assets/img/experian/eresolve-01.jpg" alt="Landing page - Mobile" title="Landing page - Mobile" class="mb2 mt2" />
<img src="/assets/img/experian/eresolve-05.jpg" alt="Landing Page - Desktop" title="Landing Page - Desktop" class="mb2 mt2" />

<img src="/assets/img/experian/eresolve-04.jpg" alt="Payment confirmation" title="Payment confirmation" class="mb2 mt2" /></p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="what-i-have-learned-so-far">What I have learned (so far)</h3>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Data is everything. The research done before I arrived paved the way to a data-driven design approach. I can reference it to justify every design decision made.</p>

<h2 class="mt5" id="income-and-asset-verification">Income and Asset Verification</h2>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">We‚Äôre exploring some user flows and features for leveraging data to verify income and assets in lending. These few screens are part of a larger exploration demonstrating a user being presented with the ability to verify their income and assets in a digital loan process (an online mortgage application, for example).

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">I‚Äôve spent the last 6 months at <a href="http://experian.com">Experian</a> working primarily on three products: <a href="https://www.experian.com/consumer-information/virtual-debt-resolution-negotiation-eResolve.html">eResolve</a>, <a href="http://www.experian.com/blogs/news/2017/07/11/text-credit-modernizes-lending-industry-allowing-consumers-obtain-real-time-credit-via-text/">Text for Credit</a> and <a href="http://www.experian.com/consumer-information/account-aggregation-solutions.html">Income and Asset Verification</a>.  All three projects are still in progress.</p>

<h2 class="mt5" id="eresolve">eResolve</h2>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Experian offers eResolve to businesses who want to take a human-friendly, digital first approach to collections. The process is less threatening for consumers and gives them the flexibility to access their account at any time. It also increases the consistency and efficiency of the debt collection process.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="role">Role</h3>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">When I arrived at Experian, research had been conducted on an early version of eResolve. I‚Äôve since translated the insights gathered from the research into action items that will refine the product. This includes re-thinking the user flow, content strategy and visual design. After multiple iterations of sketches and rough prototypes, I presented a refined prototype to stakeholders and the development team.</p>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Now the design team is fleshing out the visual design in preparation for the development team. We‚Äôll work together with them through the development process to ensure the design is executed, with special attention to interaction, performance and device support.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> The early version of eResolve was jam-packed with extra information and heavy on decorations. This left users unsure of where to look or what to do.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> We wanted the user to have more control by negotiating payment amounts, terms and dates but also set parameters that a financial institution would accept. We are currently exploring if/how we can leverage data to propose terms that work well for both the user and the financial institution.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> After a user agrees to a payment plan, what‚Äôs the best way to interact with them? Payment reminder options, progress updates,  and pay-off celebrations are all being considered as options to continue the human-friendly approach outside of the initial experience.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> We simplified the user flow by taking a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/05/better-form-design-one-thing-per-page/">one thing per page</a>‚Äù approach: instead of putting everything on one page, we separated the process into multiple, minimal pages.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> We cleaned up the interface by removing extraneous containers, shapes, shadows and a complex layout. We added a clear typographic hierarchy, friendly color scheme and straightforward single-column layout.</p>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Here are a few mobile screens from the project showing the work done.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="what-i-have-learned-so-far">What I have learned (so far)</h3>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> <strong>Data is everything.</strong> The research done before I arrived paved the way to a data-driven design approach. I could point back to it to justify every design decision I made.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> <strong>Meaningful data comes from drawing insights from user interviews</strong> When reading or listening to user interviews, it‚Äôs important to listen <em>underneath</em> the words people say to get to the heart of the words. It‚Äôs also important to understand who they are and what they‚Äôre about for context and even more meaning.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> <strong>Listen to the user.</strong> The fewer assumptions we make about a design - and the more we ask the humans it is designed for, the better suited it will be for them.</p>

<h2 class="mt5" id="income-and-asset-verification">Income and Asset Verification</h2>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">We‚Äôre exploring some user flows and features for leveraging data to verify income and assets in lending. These few screens are part of a larger exploration demonstrating a user being presented with the ability to verify their income and assets in a digital loan process (an online mortgage application, for example).

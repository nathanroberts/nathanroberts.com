<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Custom accounts for a large part of Oakley‚Äôs direct-to-consumer business. The oakley.com Custom back-end was built by Fluid and maintained by Oakley‚Äôs e-commerce team, led by Custom PM George Steihl. The interaction design team led UI/UX for the experience.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="role">Role</h3>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">For the first half of the project, I directed the design in collaboration with Aaron Dodson. After Aaron left Oakley, I continued iterating on the design while coordinating deliverables and constant communication with the development team, all in sync with George.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p class="f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">In 2015, traffic data was showing a growing trend toward mobile for Custom. The existing experience had a three key problems we wanted to solve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The existing interface didn‚Äôt match the latest product detail page interface, which broke consistency across a user‚Äôs potential experience.</li>
  <li>When scrolling to choosing customizable attributes, a user couldn‚Äôt instantly see her changes in the hero product image because the image scrolled with the rest of the page</li>
  <li>The Add to Cart button was out of view until the user scrolled</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="solutions">Solutions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Matching the interface was pretty easy - just a matter of providing designs with updated styles to match the latest product detail page. Since we worked with a vendor to execute these updates, I managed the design, process and hand-off to the vendor development team using Zeplin.</li>
  <li>The scrolling issues were mainly a front-end development challenge. We worked closely with the development team to ensure execution was as we envisioned. We explained through a few meetings the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and also had some thoughts on the ‚Äúhow.‚Äù We also provided external site references to the interaction we wanted to mimic and eventually arrived at a solid solution.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We could have saved some time and headache explaining the scrolling interaction we envisioned to the development team with a prototype built in After Effects or Principle. Up until then, prototyping hadn‚Äôt been a part of our toolbox.</li>
  <li>Zeplin was a life-saver and likely made up for any time wasted on back-and-forth with the dev team on the scrolling interaction by streamlining deliverables. We realized the impact of this tool most here. Previously, we spent way too much time creating red-lined spec sheets for interaction-heavy projects like this one.</li>
  <li>When team members move on and it‚Äôs your responsibility to continue with a project, how do you minimize the time it takes to get familiar with the nitty-gritty of their Sketch and file organization? Fortunately, since Aaron and I collaborated closely, there was little time wasted taking over where he left off. But it‚Äôs a good idea to have a general understanding and agreement of how design files are produced in preparation for events like a teammate departure.</li>
</ul>

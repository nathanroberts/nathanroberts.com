<p class="f5 f4-m f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">At Oakley, I worked with the interaction design team, internal and external stakeholders and third-party vendors to design several native apps including <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mad-science/id981695340">Mad Science</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/radar-pace/id1108147139">Radar Pace</a>. We also shipped UX/UI, front-end development and back-end integration for <a href="http://oakley.com">oakley.com</a>‚Äôs e-commerce and marketing web experiences. In 2015, Oakley.com generated approximately $60M in revenue and approximately 36M sessions.</p>

<h2 class="mt5" id="radar-pace">Radar Pace</h2>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p class="f5 f4-m f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Oakley and <a href="http://intel.com">Intel</a> partnered to create Radar Pace, a real-time voice activated coaching system leveraging sensor-driven eyewear and your iOS or Android smartphone.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="role">Role</h3>

<p class="f5 f4-m f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">I worked with Intel‚Äôs New Devices Group UI/UX team to whiteboard ideas, create prototypes, conduct user research, present findings to stakeholders and iterate on UI/UX for Radar Pace on iOS and Android platforms. My primary role was to ensure the overall digital experience and visual design of the app met Oakley‚Äôs standards for product design.</p>

<p class="f5 f4-m f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4"><em>[Writing this now - Will touch on main sections of the app and how we arrived at the solution, visual design and working with voice interactions]</em></p>

<p class="f5 f4-m f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Here are a few screens showing the Profile and Plan sections of the app. These give you a good sense of the organization of the app and the visual design. <em>[More screens needed?]</em></p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h3>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> We got too far into the design before we put the product in front of people for feedback. <strong>Prototype as early as possible.</strong></p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> Most of the user research we did later on was in a board room. <strong>Testing prototypes with users in the intended environment</strong> provides more accurate feedback and drives clearer insights. This give us meaningful data to take action on, leading to a more focused product. This did happen later, but after the product was nearly built, costing time and money when iterating.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> The product shipped later than intended because so many features were mandated into the launch. Launching with a MVP would have shortened the development timeline, brought us to market earlier and afforded us <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">validated learning</a> for future iterations.</p>

<h2 class="mt5" id="oakley-custom">Oakley Custom</h2>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="overview-1">Overview</h3>

<p class="f5 f4-m f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">Custom accounts for a large part of Oakley‚Äôs direct-to-consumer business. The oakley.com Custom back-end was built by Fluid and maintained by Oakley‚Äôs e-commerce team, led by Custom PM George Steihl. The interaction design team led UI/UX for the experience.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="role-1">Role</h3>

<p class="f5 f4-m f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">For the first half of the project, I directed the design in collaboration with Aaron Dodson. After Aaron left Oakley, I continued iterating on the design while coordinating deliverables and constant communication with the development team, all in sync with George.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="challenges-1">Challenges</h3>

<p class="f5 f4-m f4-l lh-copy dark-gray mb4">In 2015, traffic data was showing a growing trend toward mobile for Custom. The existing experience had a three key problems we wanted to solve:</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> The existing interface didn‚Äôt match the latest product detail page interface, which broke consistency across a user‚Äôs potential experience.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> When scrolling to choosing customizable attributes, a user couldn‚Äôt instantly see her changes in the hero product image because the image scrolled with the rest of the page</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> The Add to Cart button was out of view until the user scrolled</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="solutions-1">Solutions</h3>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> Matching the interface was pretty easy - just a matter of providing designs with updated styles to match the latest product detail page. Since we worked with a vendor to execute these updates, I managed the design, process and hand-off to the vendor development team using Zeplin.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> The scrolling issues were mainly a front-end development challenge. We worked closely with the development team to ensure execution was as we envisioned. We explained through a few meetings the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and also had some thoughts on the ‚Äúhow.‚Äù We also provided external site references to the interaction we wanted to mimic and eventually arrived at a solid solution.</p>

<h3 class="mb2 mt4" id="what-i-learned-1">What I learned</h3>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> We could have saved some time and headache explaining the scrolling interaction we envisioned to the development team with a prototype built in After Effects or Principle. Up until then, prototyping hadn‚Äôt been a part of our toolbox.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> Zeplin was a life-saver and likely made up for any time wasted on back-and-forth with the dev team on the scrolling interaction by streamlining deliverables. We realized the impact of this tool most here. Previously, we spent way too much time creating red-lined spec sheets for interaction-heavy projects like this one.</p>

<p class="db ml2 mr4-ns f5 f4-ns"><strong>‚Ä¢</strong> When team members move on and it‚Äôs your responsibility to continue with a project, how do you minimize the time it takes to get familiar with the nitty-gritty of their Sketch and file organization? Fortunately, since Aaron and I collaborated closely, there was little time wasted taking over where he left off. But it‚Äôs a good idea to have a general understanding and agreement of how design files are produced in preparation for events like a teammate departure.</p>
